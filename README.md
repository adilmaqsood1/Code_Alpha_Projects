## Experience :
* This internship provided me with the opportunity to hone my technical abilities and put theory into practice in the field of web development. I was given three tasks, each of which tested me in a unique way.The first task was to establish a portfolio website. A portfolio displays your abilities, skills, and accomplishments. This project enabled me to demonstrate my abilities to create real-world web apps by displaying my coding, problem-solving, and software development skills. It enabled me to gain hands-on expertise with the alignment of various blocks.

The second project I was given was to design a responsive blog website. The goal was to design an aesthetically appealing and user-friendly platform for authors to share their thoughts and stories with the rest of the world. I began by comprehending the relevance of responsive design and its function in offering a consistent user experience across multiple devices.

The third and final assignment that awaited me was the creation of a cutting-edge resume creator. This task excited me since it provided an opportunity to assist ambitious professionals in properly exhibiting their talents and expertise.
